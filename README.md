# 🚗 Connected Vehicles Control Platform

## 📌 Description
This project implements a **web-based control and monitoring platform** for multiple TurtleBot robots, developed as part of a connected vehicles project.  
The platform allows remote interaction with each robot and provides real-time access to their sensors and telemetry.  
Robots communicate with each other to share information about **encountered obstacles**, enabling cooperative decision-making and smoother traffic flow.

## ✨ Features
- Web interface to control multiple TurtleBots (movement & actions)  
- Real-time monitoring of sensors and robot status  
- Communication between robots to report obstacles and coordinate maneuvers  
- Central server aggregates and processes data from connected vehicles (**MQTT**)  
- Remote supervision through a custom-built dashboard  
- Communication enabled via **ITS-G5 (Wi-Fi stack)** for low-latency exchanges
